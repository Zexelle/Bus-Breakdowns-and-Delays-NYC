                                               Bus Breakdowns and Delays

This project analyzes NYC bus breakdowns and delays using Excel to uncover patterns and common causes. It provides insights to help improve transit efficiency and reliability.

## Questions and Insights
📈 1. What are the most common reasons for delays and breakdowns?

Summary/Conclusions:

The majority of breakdowns are occuring due to Mechanical Problems or "Won't Start" which also seems to be a mechanical problem.

Recommendation: More precautionary maintenance done to prevent mechanical problems. Potentially have buses monthly or quarterly to reduce this.

📅 2. How do delay times vary by bus company and borough?

Summary/Conclusions:

The chart above displays the 10 bus companies that have the highest average delay or breakdown time.
Recommendation: Use this to compare to # of delays, boros, and total number of trips.

Could be mechanical issues - fix with regular maintenance OR we need to fire them.

Summary/Conclusions:

The boros with the highest delay times are the main areas of NYC. These are the areas with the highest concentration of people and vehicles which would account for the longer delays.

##

🔮 3. Is there a correlation between specific days of the week and the frequency of breakdowns or delays?

![Day of Week - Screenshot 1](https://github.com/Zexelle/Bus-Breakdowns-and-Delays-NYC/blob/main/Day%20of%20Week%20-%20Screenshot%201.png)

Summary/Conclusions:

Spike in Delays on Monday and a decrease in delays on Fridays.

Conclusion: Since the majority of delays are caused by traffic, we can assume the decrease in delays on Friday are caused by less people going into work or driving on that day.

Summary/Conclusions:

There is a gradual decrease in breakdowns throughout the week. Higher percentage of breakdowns happening on Monday and decreases throughout the week. 

Recommendation: Schedule Maintenance over weekends to help with breakdowns.
