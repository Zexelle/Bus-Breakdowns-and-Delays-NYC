## 🚌 NYC Bus Breakdowns & Delays — Excel Analysis

This project analyzes New York City’s Bus Breakdowns and Delays data using Microsoft Excel. The goal is to uncover patterns, identify common causes of delays, and provide data-driven insights to improve the city's transportation efficiency.

## 📘 Project Scenario

You have been hired by the New York Division of Transportation as a Data Analyst. The city has been facing a growing number of bus delays and breakdowns, creating frustration for commuters and putting strain on public transit resources.

Your responsibility in this project is to analyze the dataset to understand the factors contributing to service disruptions and help guide improvements.

   - Counted and ranked reasons  
   - Highlighted the top contributors using PivotTables and charts  

2. How do delay times vary by bus company and borough?
   - Compared average delay time across companies  
   - Analyzed borough-level performance  
   - Visualized patterns using PivotCharts  

3. Is there a correlation between specific days of the week and the frequency of breakdowns or delays?
   - Created weekday breakdowns using Excel formulas  
   - Identified patterns in incident frequency  
   - Highlighted high-impact days
